# Solidification Tasks

## HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT

### Task 1

ðŸ‘‰ Create an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript File. Make sure all are linked.

ðŸ‘‰ In the HTML, create an h1 containing the words "I GOT THIS!"

ðŸ‘‰ Change the color of your h1 with css to your favorite css color.

ðŸ‘‰ Create a button containing the words "remind me"

ðŸ‘‰ In the JavaScript, add a listener to the button so that when clicked, the words "YOU GOT THIS" will be logged to the console

_For each of the rest of the tasks, create a new JS file and import it into your HTML file so that it can run in the browser. If you feel overwhelmed at any point, click your button..._

## Objects and Arrays

### Task 1

```js
const bird = {
  type: "Pigeon",
  color: "purplegreygreen",
  movements: ["Head Bob", "Flap", "Cheeky Scuttle"],
  wings: {
    left: { size: 5, strength: 5 },
    right: { size: 5, strength: 4 },
  },
};
```

#### Accessing properties

ðŸ‘‰ console.log the value of the type property

ðŸ‘‰ console.log the strength of the left wing

ðŸ‘‰ console.log the first item in the list of movements

### Task 2

```js
const fish = [
  { type: "Sturgeon", size: "Big" },
  { type: "Pike", size: "Very Big" },
  { type: "Great White Shark", size: "Very Very Big" },
];
```

#### Accessing properties

ðŸ‘‰ console.log the first item in the array of fish

ðŸ‘‰ console.log the the size of the second item in the array

ðŸ‘‰ console.log the type of the last item in the array

## Loops

### Task 1

```js
let i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ refactor this while loop into a for loop

### Task 2

```js
const ingredients = [
  "Cheese",
  "Pineapple",
  "Tomato",
  "Mozzarella",
  "Flour",
  "Water",
  "Yeast",
];
```

ðŸ‘‰ write a for loop to console.log each item in the ingredients array

## Functions

### Task 1

```js
const result = isLengthEven("ben");
```

ðŸ‘‰ Write the function `isLengthEven`. It should take in a string and return true if the length of that string is even and false if the length of that string is odd

ðŸ‘‰ Call the function with your name and store in the variable `result`!

ðŸ‘‰ console.log `result`

### Task 2

ðŸ‘‰ Write a function called `formatDate` which takes in three arguments; day, month and year. Return the date as string with `/` between each number. e.g. `formatDate(1,7,1888)` would return `"1/7/1888"` \* _Optional Bonus: add a zero before the numbers that are only one digit_

ðŸ‘‰ call your function with your birthday and store the result in a variable called `date`

ðŸ‘‰ console.log `date`

### Task 3

ðŸ‘‰ Write a function that takes in a number

ðŸ‘‰ If that number is even, return the number multiplied by 7

ðŸ‘‰ If that number is odd, return the number divided by 7

ðŸ‘‰ If the function receives a string instead of a number, return undefined

## Array Methods

```js
const names = [
  "Herbert",
  "Florence",
  "Eugene",
  "Baldrick",
  "Reginald",
  "Stan",
  "Axel",
  "Archibald",
];
```

ðŸ‘‰ Use an array method and your function `isLengthEven` to create a new array from `names` with only even length names in it. Store the new array in a variable called `evenLengthNames`.

ðŸ‘‰ Use an array method and a new function. From your `evenLengthNames` array, find the index of the first item to begin with the letter `B`.

ðŸ‘‰ Use an array method and a new function to create a new array from `evenLengthNames` with all the names upper cased. The item at the index returned from the previous step should be replaced with the string `"CENSORED"` in the new array.

## DOM

### Task 1

ðŸ‘‰ Create a new `img` element and store in a variable.

ðŸ‘‰ Set the source of the new `img` element to be `"https://pics.me.me/i-heard-you-liked-json-statham-so-get-ready-for-72481175.png"`.

ðŸ‘‰ Set the alt text to be "array potter meme".

ðŸ‘‰ Append the `img` element to the body of the document.

### Task 2

ðŸ‘‰ Write a function that when called will change the src of the `img` element to be `"https://scontent.flhr4-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/17038707_1666746423619719_8198474063251261060_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&_nc_sid=9267fe&_nc_ohc=JkAozooa3LEAX-UsUBs&_nc_ht=scontent.flhr4-2.fna&oh=5efb8beb56a536c1eb0577fd5fae8e4d&oe=5F9A2C3F"` and the alt text to `"js console meme"`

ðŸ‘‰ Add an event listener to the button with id `"click-me"` which calls your function on click.

## Timeouts and Intervals

```js
let count = 0;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Write a function that adds one to the count variable and console.logs the updated count.

ðŸ‘‰ Use `setInterval` to have you function called every 1000 milliseconds.

ðŸ‘‰ Store the return value of `setInterval` in variable called intervalId

ðŸ‘‰ Write a function that will clear your interval using `clearInterval`

ðŸ‘‰ Use `setTimeout` to call that function after a random number of milliseconds between 5000 and 15000.

ðŸ‘‰ Take bets on what number the count will get to, closest wins!

## Fetch

ðŸ‘‰ Write a new function called `sendFetch`

ðŸ‘‰ Within `sendFetch`, send a GET request to `https://swapi.dev/api/people/1` and await the promise. Storing the fulfilled value in a variable called response.

ðŸ‘‰ Get the json out of the response and store in a variable called data.

ðŸ‘‰ console.log the data and poke around.

ðŸ‘‰ Get some data from within the object, using the keys that you found during the console.log stage.
